# dotfiles
This is my simple dotfiles setup, used primarily in OS X.


**install:** Checks to see if homebrew is installed, installs it if it's not and then moves .bashrc

**.bashrc:** Sets the bash prompt and binds a few aliases

**Brewfile:** List of programs for homebrew to install

### Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/moggg/dotfiles.git
chmod +x install
./install
```
